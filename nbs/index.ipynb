We avoided the NIH syndrome and built it on top of powerful Open Source models: [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) from OpenAI to generate semantic tokens and perform transcription, [EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec) from Meta for acoustic modeling and [Vocos](https://github.com/charactr-platform/vocos) from Charactr Inc as the high-quality vocoder."
